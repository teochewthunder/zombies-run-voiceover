# *Zombies, Run!* voiceover

This is a silly little VBScript program designed to imitate a design spec of *Zombies, Run!*.

The end result is for the program to say a generated sentence, in the following format.

- (quantity)(units) of (items), eg *Collected three boxes of lightbulb.s*
- (quantity)(items), eg *Collected four toolboxes.*

A VBScript random number generator is used in the generation, both to generate quantities, and item types.

Potentially, the program should be able to say something like this...
*Collected two axes, a box of lightbulbs, five overcoats and a handful of money.*
